		- Hey, you've spent a lotta time not learning/working today.
		  Becaues:
			- Doing chores that could have been done later (by Mom just un capable of waiting and things have to be done when she thinks of it...)
			- Waiting on Mom to prep dinner, although we had dinner to eat.
			  (I'm not saying that I'm mad, I appreciate her making us warm food; I'm just trying to get at that if it wasn't for that I probs could have gotten in at least an hour more work/study time)
		- What's up with audio diaries? 
		  Maybe I should start doing them again from time to time? :thinking:
